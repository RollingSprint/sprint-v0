Sprint v0 — GitHub README (Public)

----Overview----
Sprint v0 is a solo, non-competitive reference sprint for RollingSprint.
Its purpose is to validate sprint scope, documentation standards, and the 4-week execution model before opening participation to others.
This sprint establishes the baseline quality bar for all future RollingSprint competitions.

----Sprint Type----
- Solo
- Junior-level scope
- Mobile application
- Reference implementation (not ranked)

----Objective----
Build a demo-ready mobile application within a 4-week timebox.
The focus is on:
- Completing a coherent core feature set
- Making clear architectural decisions
- Communicating tradeoffs effectively
- Polish, feature volume, and production infrastructure are explicitly secondary.

----Timeline----
Week 0: Sprint kickoff & planning
Weeks 1–3: Build phase
Week 4: Finalization, demo, and self-evaluation

----Deliverables----
By the end of Sprint v0, the following artifacts must be complete and public:
- Source code repository
- README.md
- ARCHITECTURE.md
- DECISIONS.md
- DEMO.md
- Demo recording or live walkthrough
- Postmortem summary
- Demo-Ready Definition

----Demo-ready App Requirements----
- It launches successfully
- One full core user flow works end-to-end
- No crashes occur during demo
- Data persists locally or via a simple backend
  
----Explicitly Out of Scope----
- App Store / Play Store submission
- Authentication systems
- Payments
- Notifications
- Pixel-perfect UI
- Production-scale infrastructure

----Evaluation----
Sprint v0 is self-evaluated using the official Junior Rubric.
Results are used only for:
- Internal validation
- Judge calibration
- Public reference
- No ranking or leaderboard placement occurs.

----Final Note----
Sprint v0 defines the standard.
Future sprints will be judged against the clarity, completeness, and execution demonstrated here.
